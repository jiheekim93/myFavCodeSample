# myFavCodeSample

This code snippet is from an e-commerce app using Express(Backend) and React(Frontend).

I used axios to fetch the data to show all the items on the website with CRUD fuctionality.
And added the login athentication with session that gives only users who have accounts can see the delete button and delete the posts in the modal when they click to see its detail information.
